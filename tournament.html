<h2><blockquote><p align="left">
eSports (also known as electronic sports, esports, e-sports, competitive (video) gaming, professional (video) gaming, or pro gaming) is a form of competition that is facilitated by electronic systems, particularly video games; the input of players and teams as well as the output of the eSports system are mediated by human-computer interfaces. Most commonly, eSports take the form of organized, multiplayer video game competitions, particularly between (but not limited to) professional players.<br><br>
I enjoy watching eSport tournaments live on streaming services such as twitch.tv, and it has become a fun way to keep up with games even if I don't play them.
